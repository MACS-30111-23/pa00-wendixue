# Git/GitHub Workflow
For this homework, I adopted a typical Git/GitHub workflow, which involved the following steps:

* __Cloning the repository__: I began by cloning the repository from GitHub to my local machine. This allowed me to work on the project offline and manage my changes more effectively.
* __Making Changes Locally__: After cloning, I worked on the project files on my local machine. I created a structured directory and ensured that my files were properly organized before committing the changes.
* __Committing Changes__: After making significant progress, I used git add to stage my files and git commit -m "message" to commit the changes with descriptive messages. Writing good commit messages helped me track my progress clearly.
* __Pushing to GitHub__: Once I was happy with my local changes, I pushed the changes back to GitHub using git push. This helped me keep a version-controlled backup of my work.
* __Using Branches__: While I didn’t create a new branch for this simple project, I’m aware that for more complex projects, working on different branches could help isolate features or fixes, allowing for a more modular development process.
* __Pull Requests__: In larger collaborative projects, creating pull requests and asking for reviews would be important steps, but for this individual work, I mainly worked in the main branch.

## Reflection on Markdown
Markdown was an essential part of this homework since it’s lightweight and allows for easy formatting. I used Markdown to structure my README file and other documents within the project. Here are a few things I learned:
* __Image Embedding__: One of the more interesting things I learned was how to embed images directly into a README file using Markdown syntax. I was able to showcase an image of my cat, Bailey, which made my README more personal and visually appealing.

* __Surprises__: One thing that surprised me was how simple it is to format text in Markdown. I initially thought I would need extensive HTML or CSS knowledge, but Markdown’s simplicity (e.g., for headings, lists, and emphasis) allowed me to create a well-structured document with minimal effort.

* __Challenges__: A minor challenge I encountered was making sure that links and images displayed correctly on GitHub. I learned that the paths to files (like images) should be relative to the project structure in GitHub, not my local machine.

_Overall, I found both GitHub and Markdown intuitive to use, and I’m confident that these tools will be essential in future projects, especially for collaboration and documentation._
